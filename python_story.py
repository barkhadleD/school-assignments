Once upon a time there were three little '''+ prey +''''s and the time came for them to 
leave home and seek their fortunes. Before they left, their mother told them
" Whatever you do , do it the best that you can because that's the way to get
along in the world.

The first little '''+ prey + ''' built his house out of straw because it was the easiest
thing to do. The second little '''+ prey +''' built his house out of sticks. This was a
little bit stronger than a straw house. The third little '''+ prey +''' built his house
out of bricks.

One night the big bad '''+ predator +''', who dearly loved to eat fat little '''+ prey +''', came
along and saw the first little '''+ prey +''' in his house of straw. He said "Let me in,
Let me in, little ''' +prey+ ''' or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!"
"Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin", said the little '''+ prey +'''. But of course 
the '''+ predator +''' did blow the house in and ate the first little '''+ prey +'''.

The '''+ predator +''' then came to the house of sticks. "Let me in ,Let me in little '''+ prey +'''
or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in" "Not by the hair of 
my chinny chin chin", said the little pig. But the wolf blew that house in 
too, and ate the second little '''+ prey +'''.

The '''+ predator +''' then came to the house of bricks. " Let me in , let me in" cried the  
'''+ predator +''' "Or I'll huff and I'll puff till I blow your house in" "Not by the hair 
of my chinny chin chin" said the '''+ prey +'''. Well, the '''+ predator +''' huffed and puffed but 
he could not blow down that brick house.

But the '''+ predator +''' was a sly old '''+ predator +''' and he climbed up on the roof to look for 
a way into the brick house.

The little '''+ prey +''' saw the '''+ predator +''' climb up on the roof and lit a roaring fire 
in the fireplace and placed on it a large kettle of water.

When the '''+ predator + ''' finally found the hole in the chimney he crawled down and 
KERSPLASH right into that kettle of water and that was the end of his 
troubles with the big bad '''+ predator +'''.

The next day the little '''+ prey +''' invited his mother over . She said "You see it is 
just as I told you. The way to get along in the world is to do things as well 
as you can." Fortunately for that little '''+ prey +''', he learned that lesson
. And he just lived happily ever after!
